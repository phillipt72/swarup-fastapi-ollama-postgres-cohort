# Module 2 — POST and Pydantic Echo

**Single fundamental:** a request-response cycle has typed input and typed output. Validation lives at the boundary.

The page now has a textarea and an Ask button. Submitting sends a JSON `POST /ask` to the backend. The backend validates the body with Pydantic and **echoes the question back as the answer**. No LLM yet — Module 3 introduces it.

## Class Flow (5 steps)

1. **Open** this folder (`dist/module_02_post_pydantic_echo/`) in Antigravity.
2. **Run** it — paste the *Run* commands below into your terminal. Use the page in your browser.
3. **Read** `app/main.py` in your editor. Two Pydantic classes (`AskRequest`, `AskResponse`) and one POST route — that's the typing in action.
4. **Ask Gemini** to explain it — paste the **Primary prompt** under *Ask Gemini* below into the chat panel. Read what Gemini says. Ask follow-ups.
5. **Answer the Defend It question** at the bottom yourself before moving to Module 3.

(Optional 6th — for hands-on learners: try the *Tweak* suggestion at the end.)

## Run

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Open **http://localhost:8000**, type something in the textarea, click Ask.

## Verify (the three-error-codes drill — self-check)

```bash
# 200 — happy path, typed response
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question":"hello"}'

# 400 — value error (handler's business rule: empty after strip)
curl -s -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n" -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"question":""}'

# 422 — shape error (Pydantic: missing field)
curl -s -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n" -X POST http://localhost:8000/ask \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{}'
```

## Interactive API documentation (a free outcome of typing)

While `uvicorn` is still running, open **http://localhost:8000/docs** in your browser. FastAPI auto-generates this page from the Pydantic models and route signatures in `app/main.py` — you wrote zero documentation.

What to look at:

- **Endpoint list** — POST `/ask` is listed automatically. GET `/` (the HTML page) is also there.
- **Click POST `/ask`** → see the request body schema with `question: string`, marked **required** because `AskRequest` defines no default.
- **Responses section** — 200 returns `AskResponse` (`answer: string`). 422 is the validation error schema you saw in the curl drill above.
- **"Try it out"** — click the button, fill the `question` field, hit Execute. The response panel shows the same 200 / 422 / 400 you got with curl, without typing curl. Try body `{}` for 422; try `{"question":"   "}` for 400.
- **Schemas section** at the bottom — every Pydantic model in the app, browsable.

From Module 3 onwards, `/docs` is also your fastest debug tool: when something looks wrong in the browser, paste the same payload into "Try it out" and see what the server actually returned — body, status, and headers. There is also `/redoc` (a read-only, magazine-style version) — bookmark whichever you prefer.

## Ask Gemini

**Primary prompt** (paste this first into the chat panel):

> Open `app/main.py`. Compare it to the Module 1 version. Walk me through everything that changed and tell me which changes are "the same idea expressed in two places" vs "two different responsibilities". Don't tell me which is which — ask me to guess first.

### More questions if you want to go deeper

**About the two error codes:**
> A request with `{"question":""}` returns 400. A request with `{}` returns 422. They look like the same kind of "the request was bad" failure to me. Make me articulate the difference between them.

**About the Pydantic models:**
> `AskResponse` has only one field: `answer: str`. Why bother defining a class for one field instead of just returning `{"answer": ...}` directly? Coach me into seeing what `response_model=AskResponse` is doing for me.

**The "where does validation live" question:**
> Pydantic validates the request body before my function runs. What would my code look like if Pydantic didn't exist and I had to do the same validation by hand inside `ask()`? Show me. Then tell me which version is easier to maintain and why.

**About the JavaScript:**
> Open `app/templates/index.html`. The `fetch()` call sends `Content-Type: application/json`. Try removing that header in the JavaScript and submit the form. What error do you predict? Now actually try it. Were you right?

**About the auto-generated `/docs` page:**
> Open http://localhost:8000/docs. Walk me through how FastAPI knew that the request body has a required `question: string` field, that the response has an `answer: string` field, and that 422 is a possible status code. What in `app/main.py` generated each of those things? What would I have to write by hand if I were using a framework that didn't auto-generate this?

**Curiosity / "what if":**
> What if I wanted `/ask` to accept either JSON or a plain HTML form post? What would I have to change? Is that a doctrine-compliant change for Module 2? Why or why not?

**Self-check before you move to Module 3:**
> Module 3 replaces the echo with a real call to the local Ollama LLM. Predict: what's the smallest amount of new code that has to land in `/ask` to make this happen? What new package will need to be installed?

## Tweak (optional, for hands-on learners)

Add a second field to `AskRequest`, e.g. `mood: str`. Save (uvicorn auto-reloads). Submit the form — does it still work? Now open `/docs` and notice your new field is documented with `mood` marked **required**. Send a request without it via "Try it out" — observe the 422 error message. Then revert.

## Defend It (do not paste into Gemini — answer it yourself)

> Why is 422 different from 400 here? Couldn't they both be 400?
