# Module 7 — Refactor into Layers

**Single fundamental:** a maintainable codebase separates concerns. Each file has one reason to change.

**No user-visible change.** The acceptance test is that every Module 6 verification still passes byte-for-byte. The single `app/main.py` from Modules 1–6 is split into:

```
app/
├── main.py              # FastAPI app, routes only
├── schemas.py           # AskRequest, AskResponse, Interaction
├── database.py          # DATABASE_URL, get_conn (introduced HERE)
└── services/
    ├── ollama_service.py        # OLLAMA_URL, OLLAMA_MODEL, SYSTEM_PROMPT, call_ollama()
    └── interaction_service.py   # save_interaction, fetch_recent_history
```

`SYSTEM_PROMPT` migrates from `app/main.py` into `services/ollama_service.py`, alongside the function that uses it.

## Class Flow (5 steps)

1. **Open** this folder (`dist/module_07_refactor_layers/`) in Antigravity.
2. **Run** it — paste the *Run* command. The page works exactly the same as Module 6. *That's the point.*
3. **Read** `app/main.py` (now short — just routes), `app/services/ollama_service.py` (everything Ollama-related), `app/services/interaction_service.py` (everything DB-related), `app/schemas.py`, `app/database.py`. Each file has one job.
4. **Ask Gemini** to explain it — paste the **Primary prompt** under *Ask Gemini* below into the chat panel. Read what Gemini says. Ask follow-ups.
5. **Answer the Defend It question** at the bottom yourself before moving to Module 8.

(Optional 6th — for hands-on learners: try the *Tweak* suggestion at the end. This one is the most instructive in the course.)

## Run

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt 
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Verify (self-check)

Run every Module 6 verification — all responses must be byte-identical to Module 6. The structural diff is the proof we're done. Open `dist/module_06_read_history/app/` and `dist/module_07_refactor_layers/app/` side by side in your editor. Same behaviour, different shape — that's the lesson.

(Maintainer aside: if you have the source-of-truth tag history in your clone, `git diff --stat v1-module-6-complete v1-module-7-complete -- app/` shows the same picture as a stat summary.)

## Ask Gemini

**Primary prompt** (paste this first into the chat panel):

> Behaviour is identical to Module 6. So what changed? Open `app/main.py` and `app/services/ollama_service.py` side by side. Coach me through what 'separation of concerns' means here — what does this refactor make easier to do tomorrow that Module 6's single file made hard?

### More questions if you want to go deeper

The build phase is winding down. By now you have your own way of asking. The prompts below are starters, not a script.

**Articulate the gain:**
> This refactor changed nothing the user can see. Convince me — using maintainability arguments only, no hand-waving — that this work was worth doing. If I push back, push back harder.

**Pick something that surprised you in the refactor and explore it.** Open one of the new files (`schemas.py`, `database.py`, `services/ollama_service.py`, or `services/interaction_service.py`). Pick one design choice that surprised you. Write a prompt to ask Gemini about it. Share what Gemini said with a peer in your cohort.

## Tweak (optional, for hands-on learners)

Move `SYSTEM_PROMPT` from `app/services/ollama_service.py` back into `app/main.py` (where it lived in Modules 4–6). Save. Restart uvicorn. Notice **nothing changed for the user** — the app still works. Now revert. Ask yourself: why is the refactored location better, given both work? Hint: the next time you swap LLM providers, which file do you want to touch?

## Defend It (do not paste into Gemini — answer it yourself)

> We didn't change any behaviour. What did we gain?
